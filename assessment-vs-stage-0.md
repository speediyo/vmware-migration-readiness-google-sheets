# VMware Migration Assessment vs. Stage-0 (2025)

This brief compares a **full VMware migration assessment** with a **Stage-0 readiness baseline**, and explains how the two approaches complement each other.

---

## What is a VMware Migration Assessment?
A VMware migration assessment is a **comprehensive evaluation** of your vSphere environment. Vendors or partners usually lead these projects, collecting data from multiple systems and delivering:

- **Infrastructure inventory** – hosts, clusters, VMs, VMware features in use  
- **Operational review** – backup, DR, change management, automation practices  
- **Dependency mapping** – application/service relationships across VMs  
- **Performance & capacity modeling** – sizing workloads for target platforms  
- **Cost & TCO modeling** – pricing scenarios across cloud or alternative hypervisors  
- **Risk & roadmap** – validated risks, phased wave plans, and execution timelines  

These assessments are detailed and critical for planning—but they require time, vendor participation, and capacity.

## What is a Stage-0 Baseline?
A Stage-0 baseline is a **fast, agentless first step** run entirely in your own environment. It needs only two CSV exports:

1. **vCenter inventory** (via RVTools or vSphere export)  
2. **Backup inventory** (e.g., Veeam, Rubrik, Commvault)  

From these inputs, Stage-0 produces:

- **Per-VM readiness bands** (Red/Yellow/Green)  
- **Reasons for flags** (missing backup, stale backup, uptime >180 days, compliance tags)  
- **Rollups** by cluster, OS family, backup posture, and uptime class  

It is transparent, editable (Google Sheets/Excel), and vendor-neutral.

## How They Fit Together
| Stage                 | Scope                            | Who Runs It          | Key Outputs                              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Stage-0 Baseline**  | vCenter + backup CSVs            | Internal IT          | R/Y/G bands, reasons, basic rollups      |
| **Stage-1 Assessment**| Adds dependencies, performance   | Vendor/partner       | Detailed migration plan, validated risks |
| **Stage-2 Analysis**  | Adds pricing, TCO, wave design   | Vendor + procurement | Costed scenarios, SOW, execution roadmap |

Running Stage-0 first **saves time and effort**. It gives IT teams a clear starting point, so vendor conversations can move **faster and more confidently** into Stage-1 discovery and planning.

## Neutral Takeaways
- A **full VMware migration assessment** is essential for accurate planning and execution.  
- A **Stage-0 baseline** is the **efficient first step**: it reduces effort, builds confidence, and accelerates vendor-led work.  
- Together, they form a practical pathway: Stage-0 → Stage-1 vendor assessment → Stage-2 cost & execution planning.
